## Intro
If you are a coffee lover like me, have you ever wonder how did we found such
amazing kind of bean and turn it into a drink?
If you do, well it's your lucky day cuz today I will tell you exactly that story

The story took part in Ethiopia in the 9th century.
There was a goat herder named Kaldi.
One day, Kaldi noticed that one of his goat became very energetic and
couldn't sleep at night after eating berries of certain bush
Curios, he tried the berries himself and
found that they gave him similar burst of energy.

Kaldi then reported his discovery to the local monastery, where
monks experimented with the berries and discovered that they could be used to 
make a drink with an invigorating effect.

The drink quickly became popular among the monks, who used it 
to help them stay alert during long hours of prayer and meditation.

News of the drink spread, and eventually made its way to the Islamic World
Under the Ottoman empire
From 17th to 19th century, its made it way to the European
and they loved it also 

## Origin and History of coffee in Vietnam
At the time in 19th century, Vietnam was under French control.
Realized the dirt quality and the weather here will be a good fit for coffee production
French businesses start the first coffee plantation at HÃ  Nam in 1886, a province 50km from Ha Noi
to the south. In the late 1918 coffee production land in the north reach 4000ha.
The coffee bean became a major source of income for Vietnam in early years of 20th century
After Vietnam government take back the control from the French,
Vietnam was caught into another war, the American war from Vietnamese point of view
or the Vietnam war from American point of view
The production of coffee interrupt during the time
Until 1989, Vietnam government start doing economic reforms and brings back the coffee production
Today it's 213k.ha, 50 times bigger compared to 1918s.

## Differences between Vietnamese coffee and the coffee you know
You might or might not know but Vietnam currently hold
the title of "second largest coffee producer".
Here in Vietnam, coffee is the most popular drink and you can find it any place in the country
From the North to the South, East to West
There are many kinds of coffee in the world but two most known is Arabica and Robusta bean
Arabica has low caffeine, less bitter, stronger coffee aroma with a sour flavor
Robusta in the other hand has more caffeine in it so it's bitter less fat and
Vietnam mainly produce Robusta bean
That's why people here make beverage mostly from Robusta
The bitter flavor make us strong for the whole day long
Sometime we mix Arabica and Robusta together to make a less bitty and not too sour mixture

## Present on Giang Coffee
Early 1900s, coffee in Vietnam has two main consumers,
Local consumer - the French in Vietnam
External consumer - European
Hanoi - or Tonkin at the time was the head quarter of French colonial government
The French love cappuccino but there was a shortage of condensed milk in the 1930s
in the time World War Two happening
Mr.Giang, a bartender at Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel came up with an idea,
using egg yolk as a replacement for condensed milk
It became a hit and beloved drink until this day
The location of his shop  changes over time but
you can now find it at 39 Nguyen Huu Huan, Hoan Kiem, Ha Noi.
