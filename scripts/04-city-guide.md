### Greeting
Hello everyone, good morning,<br>
my name is Thụy and I am thrilled to be your free tour guide.
Our theme today is about Vietnamese cuisine so I hope you guys are prepared to
get some taste.

### Intro
Vietnamese cuisine /encompasses/ the foods and beverages of Vietnam.<br>
Meals feature a combination of five fundamental tastes:
- sweet, salty, bitter, sour and spicy.<br>

The distinctive of each dish reflects one or more elements (such as nutrients
and colors),<br>
which are also based around /five-pronged/ philosophy.<br>
Vietnamese recipes use ingredients like:
- ginger, lemongrass, mint, cinnamon, bird's eye chilli, lime...

You might think "wait, is that every Asian food you just describe?"<br>
Oh almost my friend, despite the similarity in spices, <br>
every countries, regions or even from home to home has unique dishes and flavor.<br>
But there are some commons features in Vietnamese home meal.<br>

And, the difference between Western countries compared to Vietnam is significant.<br>
###### The food:
- Western might have only bread for lunch, followed by pizza for dinner.
- Some Vietnamese have that same course but typically, most of Vietnamese
family will have hot food like cooked white rice at least.
###### Eating habit:
- In the west, most people will have food in their own plate of food
- In Vietnam the dishes are placed on the table and everybody shares the food

We will go a little deeper in Vietnamese family meal. <br>
### A typical Vietnamese family meal will have
- Freshness food:
    - Meats are cooked in various ways, from briefly cooked like in Phở,
    or /braised/ like Thịt Kho.
    - Veges are eaten fresh like Bò tái chanh /Shreadded salad with rare beef/;
    if they are cooked, they are boiled or briefly stir-fried.
- Presence of herbs and vegetables.
- Variety and harmony of textures: Crisp with soft, watery with crunchy,
delicate with rough.
- At least one broths or soup-based dish
- Presentation: colorful and arranged in eye pleasing manners.
- One thing that cannot be miss, cooked white rice
Norther the less, the best food is the food that still hot, strait out the oven is *\*Italian hand sign\**

### Unique eating and table manners
And to join a Vietnamese meal, there are some /dining etiquette/ that you should
pay attention for:
- Pass everything using both hands
- DO NOT stick your chopsticks vertically in the middle of the rice bowl<br>
because this only appear in funeral
- Hold the rice bowl close to your face while eating, if you lean forward and eat 
while it on the table, it's the "dog eating position"
- Only pick up food on the surface, do not dig down because it is in polite to
pick the good piece and leave the not-so-good to others
- When you are done eating, place your chopsticks on top of your rice bowl<br>
And there are some more..., but don't be afraid and turn down an offer from a Viet
family to join their meal, hehe.

### Crazy food/dishes in Vietnam
Beside the "nice looking, tasty food" like Phở or Bánh mỳ, we also have "crazy looking, 
not very pleasant to eat" kind of food
- Trứng vịt lộn/Duck embryo: boiled egg with /fetus/ already shaped duck
- Dog meat
- Snake meat
- Frog meat
- Rice paddy rat
- Natural blood pudding, usually pigs' or ducks'
Well, there are many more but this is just some instances<br>
I can take you to some places to try those in this tour if you like.
