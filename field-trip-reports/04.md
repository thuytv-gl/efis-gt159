# DEMO 04 - Temple Of Literature + Vietnamese Military Museum 

## Temple of literature
#### The reason it was built
The site was built in 1070 by Lý Thánh Tông to worship Confucius  
Why Confucius you asked? Because part of Confucius ideology is to encourage  
loyalty between ones King and Lý Thánh Tông want to spread this ideology to his people.  
Why kings came before Lý dynasty did not do what Ly dynasty have done?  
Because ancient Vietnam was under ruler of many ancient China's dynasties (from 2nd century BC to 10th century AD)  
And even there are many dynasty came before Ly, they all short lived (10 - 40 years top).  
After gaining autonomy, their society are not stable enough and they have wars after wars to fight. Therefore they have no time to do either education nor making ideology.  
Ly was the first long last dynasty (200 years+) and built a stable society, enough to think about it own ideology and how to keep the power run in king's family.

#### About education side of the temple
1072 prince Lý Càn Đức become king in his very young age (5yo) after his father Lý Thánh Tôn passed away, his temple title is Lý Nhân Tông.
This place was used to do his study.
1076, he opened Quốc Tử Giám school next to the temple, this could be considered as the first University of Vietnam and only used to teach children of noble families;

1253, under Trần dynasty, Trần Thái Tông open the gate for not only noble but for all children with excellent learning ability from commoner families.  
- home school was an option before this school came around
- under china domination, they don't want people get too smart --> no schools for common folks
