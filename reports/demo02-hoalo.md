## Hoa Lo prison
Preface
A tour to the past, begin from the 1st industrial revolution from the far England.
- Steam engine was invented in the late 18th century, production in many fields goes up dramatically
- With the need of materials and resources combined with application of steam engine in sea travel   
  England start sailing and conquer the world on huge boats and gun powder.
- The French start a bit late but quickly catchup and get their own share in South East Asia

French in Vietnam...
- French came to Vietnam in 1858, arrived at Da Dang with 
- 1858, arrived at Da Nan with just fourteen steam engine powered warships and 3000 troops.
- They invaded and took over the South of Vietnam in 1859.
- 16 years later they colonized the whole country and start exploiting resources

What is prison for?
- From the beginning, prison serve only two purposes
  + Lock the crimes away from the weak
  + Lock the ones that go against the ideology of the rulers
- Hoa Lo was built to serve the second purpose,
  locked down those Vietnamese that want to be free from the French colonialist

Crimes that Political Prisoners have taken:
- There was no such thing calls Human Right in Hoa Lo under French ruler
- One pairs of pants and shirt for 4 seasons, freezingly cold winter is not the rulers problem
- Torture in numerous ways
  + Hug up and balance on gasoline can
  + Dip prisoners head in water barrel
  + Put prisoners in barrel and pounding with baton
  + Hug up and use their body as sandbag for boxing
  + Eat/shit/live in the same space
  + ...many others
- The main purpose of those torture is to low down the fighting spirit of political prisoners
- The remaining of Hoa Lo is 1/4 (a quarter) of it original size
- The rest get destroyed by American bomb or repurposed to living space

The Vietnam war and American pilots:
- Captured American Pilots was kept here from 1964 till the end of the war
- The American call this place "Hilton Hotel" sarcastically
- They said North Vietnam Army treated US prisoners better than French treated Vietnamese (no doubt)
- IMHO: US prisoners be tortured for sure,
  + but they are valuable assets
  + keep them alive for trade is the best strategy
THE END

## There are lots of religions in the world
- We can divide believes and religions into for big categories
  + anti-religion: brings hate attitude toward any religions
  + irreligion: doesn't have belief in religions or against religions
  + nonreligious: neutral, brings no hate nor belief in religions
  + religious: Believe and practice religion

- Be respectful to all religions and people believe (if it brings no harms)
