## Intro
Have you ever lifting a cup of coffee, take a sip, enjoy the aroma 
while wondering about the origin of coffee, how did it got there at your table?
Well, it's your lucky day cuz today I will tell you exactly that story

The story took part in Ethiopia in the 9th century.
There was a goat herder named Kaldi.
One day, Kaldi noticed that one of his goat became very energetic and
couldn't sleep at night after eating berries from a certain plant
Curios, he tried the berries himself and
found that they gave him similar burst of energy.

Kaldi then reported his discovery to the local monastery, where
monks experimented with the berries and discovered that they could be used to 
make a drink with an invigorating effect.

The drink quickly became popular among the monks, who used it 
to help them stay alert during long hours of prayer and meditation.

News of the drink spread, and eventually made its way to the Islamic World
Under the Ottoman empire
From 17th to 19th century, its made it way to the European
and they loved it also 

## Origin and History of coffee in Vietnam

to the south. In the late 1918 coffee production land in the north reach 4000ha.

## Differences between Vietnamese coffee and the coffee you know

the title of "second largest coffee producer".
Here in Vietnam, coffee is the most popular drink and you can find it any place in the country
From the North to the South, East to West
There are many kinds of coffee in the world but two most known is Arabica and Robusta seed
Arabica has low caffeine, less bitter, stronger coffee aroma with a sour flavor
Robusta in the other hand has more caffeine in it so it's bitter less fat and

Most of the coffee produced in Vietnam is Robusta coffee
That's why people here make beverage mostly from Robusta seed
The bitter flavor make us strong for the whole day long
Sometime we mixed Arabica and Robusta together to make a it less bitty but not too sour
