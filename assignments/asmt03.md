The took part in Ethiopia in the 9th century.
There was a goat herder named Kaldi.
One day, Kaldi noticed that one of his goat became very energetic and
couldn't sleep at night after eating berries from a certain plant
Curios, he tried the berries himself and
found that they gave him similar burst of energy.

Kaldi then reported his discovery to the local monastery, where
monks experimented with the berries and discovered that they could be used to 
make a drink with an invigorating effect.

The drink quickly became popular among the monks, who used it 
to help them stay alert during long hours of prayer and meditation.

News of the drink spread, and eventually made its way to the Islamic World
Under the Ottoman empire
From 17th to 19th century, its made it way to the European
and they loved it also
