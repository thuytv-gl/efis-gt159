# Sword Lake: Discussion
Q: How did the lake got the name
Story:
```
    Many years ago, ways back to the 2nd century BC,
    ancient Viet Nam, An Nam was dominating by the Han Empire, ancient China.
    For many years, Vietnam was under control of many China's Empires (Tang, Song, Yuan).
    During this time, they did many horible things, including homogenization the people
    Until the 15th century, the Ming Empire was in charge.
    Our story takes place during this time.
    Ming dynasty was brutal, they treated people like trash,
    do unjust acts that make people of An Nam hate them bitterly and revolt.
    Started with the uprishing of Lam Son Rebellion.
    # FYI:
        Lam Son is a mountainous region in Thanh Hoa,
        a province located 300km (180 miles) away from Hanoi
    But with limited resources against the superior weapons and highly trained army,
    the lost of the rebellion is inevitable.
    Seeing this dismal situation, Duc Long Quan (Dragon King of the seas)
    decided to help An Nam people.
    # Quest: Ask the audience to guess the way Dragon King used to help
