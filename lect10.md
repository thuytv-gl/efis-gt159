Group 2:
- Angry, depressed and disappointed
- Root cause: came from the TG, lack of knowledge and inflexibility
- Now I have the time to think about this matter:
 + Be open minded and accept the fact
 + Be calm
- Improve the reflection by joining debate club
  + Prepare the knowledge
  + Soft skills, people skills
